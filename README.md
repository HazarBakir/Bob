# Bob

## Overview

### Concept

In Magara Game Jam 23, the theme "mysterious machine" was revealed. Our game begins with an unknown object falling into the home of our character, Bob, who is watching TV. With each contact with the object, Bob is teleported to a different universe. In each level, he navigates platforms or solves puzzles to reach the object and return to his own world.

### Genre

The game is a platform/puzzle.

## Gameplay and Mechanics

### Controls

Use arrow keys or "w, a, s, d" to move, "space" to jump, and "e" to interact.

### Mechanics

Mechanics vary from level to level. One idea is a button-press sequence on the object in each level, with one button becoming clear at the end. Bob notes these in a notepad. When the correct combination is clicked, he can return to his world.

## Story and Characters

### Story

Bob, having a peaceful day at home, touches a mysterious object that entered through his broken window, finding himself in a different place. This object is an advanced machine allowing travel between parallel universes! Bob must solve the mystery of the machine and return to his world to watch his favorite show starting on TV.

### Characters

- **Bob**: The main character who, while wanting to watch his favorite show, ends up traveling between parallel universes.
